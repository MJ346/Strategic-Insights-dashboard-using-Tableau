This repository contains the link to my Tableau dashboard and a related video tutorial.
“This dashboard is built around a pilot case for Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution looking to launch new credit cards. I worked on a sample dataset of 4,000 customers from 5 cities, analyzing their online spending patterns, income levels, and other attributes. The goal was to uncover customer segments and behaviors that could guide the launch of customized credit card offerings.”

🔹 Top KPIs Section
What it shows: Total spending, number of customers, average spend, etc.
“These KPIs give the bank an immediate pulse of their potential market — for example, the average spend per customer helps in defining the reward structure.”

🔹 City-wise Breakdown
What it shows: Comparison of spending across Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, etc.
“Hyderabad and Mumbai show higher average online spending, indicating a more mature or affluent market — ideal for launching premium or travel-based cards first.”

🔹 Customer Segmentation (by Income, Age, Marital Status)
What it shows: Spend patterns across different segments.
“Younger age groups with mid-to-high income levels show strong engagement with online shopping and travel — they would benefit from lifestyle rewards or digital-first features.”

🔹 Spending Category Analysis (If Present)
What it shows: What categories people spend most on — e.g., shopping, dining, groceries.
“Credit cards offering targeted cashback in these top categories can boost adoption and satisfaction.”
💡 3. Strategic Recommendations

“Launch three card variants: Lifestyle (for young professionals), Travel (for high spenders), and Budget (for value shoppers).”

“Roll out initially in Hyderabad and Mumbai where spending is highest.”

“Use analytics to create dynamic benefits based on user segments and behavior.”
